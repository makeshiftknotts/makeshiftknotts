- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @makeshiftknotts
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding in general. I will create a simple website soon, and I am learning Java alongside this, so hopefully I can start uploading some simple Java projects to github shortly.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, alongside taking Microsoft Azure qualifications. I also want to start learning simple blockchain coding such as deploying a smart contract.
